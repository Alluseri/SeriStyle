# SeriStyle
Bring back the Early-2021 UI back to YouTube!

## Warning
I genuinely have no clue how you got there at this point unless I or someone else I invited invited you(hi to commit history checkers), but this isn't ready for prod.

## Style Clarification
I try adapting most styles and layouts directly from the old UI, but sometimes it is virtually impossible(e.g. because of script differences or I simply couldn't find what I was looking for), so there might be minor differences between what you remember and what I implemented.

## Roadmap
Most features are/will be optional, but some might misbehave without each other!

Features might appear or disappear over time, NOT THE FINAL VERSION.
